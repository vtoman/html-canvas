# Moving Ship Canvas Demo

A minimal HTML5 canvas toy where you can pilot a small rocket sprite around a black void. When you drift off one edge of the canvas, you seamlessly re-appear on the opposite side.

## Controls

Arrow-keys:

- **Left (◀)** Rotate counter-clockwise
- **Right (▶)** Rotate clockwise
- **Up (▲)** Thrust forward (accelerate)
- **Down (▼)** Reverse thrust (accelerate backward / slow down)

The ship keeps its momentum and gradually slows thanks to friction when you are not thrusting.

## How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser (no server is required).
3. Make sure the browser window has focus, then use the arrow keys to fly your ship.

That's it—have fun!
